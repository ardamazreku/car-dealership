			<p class="text" >
			Audi’s first electric car, an SUV with quattro technology, is ready to take to the road. <br>
			To celebrate this e-storical event, Audi asked two world-famous photographers from Magnum Photos,<br>
			Paolo Pellegrin and Gueorgui Pinkhassov, to spend five days at its resource-efficient production plant in Brussels.</p>
			<img  id ="myImage" src="images/audi3.jpg" style="float:center;width:40vw; height:35vh">

				<button type="button" onclick="audi(2)">Picture 3 </button>
				<button type="button" onclick ="audi(3)">Picture 4 </button>
			</p>
			<p class="text" style="float:center">Pellegrin and Pinkhassov were fascinated by the site — a historic factory converted into a groundbreaking laboratory for a 
			resource-efficient production process — and intrigued by the grace and strength of the robots, which assist the highly specialized workers. While high tech is 
			clearly key to the production of electric cars and the development of Audi e-tron technology, the series of photos produced by Pellegrin and Pinkhassov shows how
			production still relies heavily on human ingenuity, care and passion. The body of work the two photographers produced at Audi Brussels is already a vibrant and
			electrifying record of the e-story of mobility.</p>
			<p class="text" style="float:center; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> "As a photographer, I am a silent witness who uses light to intervene in a scene and transform it."

			<span class="span1" style="text-transform:none; text-align:center">How the Audi control concepts have developed</span><br><br>
			Virtual cockpit, MMI, or head-up display: the Audi control concepts have reached the pinnacle of their development in
			the Audi A8 — intuitive, connected, and up-to-date. It’s never been this easy: See how the Audi control concepts have developed thus far.</p>
			<img src="images/audi4.jpg" style="float:center;width:40vw; height:35vh">
			<p class="text" style="float:center"> Massive rocker switches, push buttons, and a dashboard full of switches: in the Audi 100, you can revel in the nostalgia overload. But
			for all the charm the analog displays might have, they just aren’t up-to-date anymore. The modern Audi control concepts, on the other hand,
			are real all-rounders. And they have to be. “The demands of traffic conditions are much higher nowadays, and the conditions are more extreme. 
			With the increase in traffic and higher driving speeds, the Audi cockpit and control concepts take on much greater importance than they previously 
			did,” says Ivo Muth, head of user interface / user experience development. Every day, he and his colleagues work to make the Audi control concepts 
			even more intuitive and easy to understand.</p>
